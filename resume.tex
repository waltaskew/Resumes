      {January 2015 - Present}
    \begin{itemize}
      \resumeItem{
        Lead team of four tasked with maintaining, deploying and
        improving data assets used for modeling tasks across the
        company. Provided project management, mentorship in
        engineering \& data analysis skills and helped determine the
        team's quarterly road maps.
      }
      \resumeItem{
        Architected and implemented an entity resolution
        system in Apache Spark capable of probabilistically
        matching millions of input records to the company's
        database of 250 million entities.
        The system operated at a scale which allowed the company
        to acquire several new clients with data volumes larger
        than the company's previous entity resolution system could
        handle, while also reducing infrastructure costs by 150
        thousand dollars annually.
      }
      \resumeItem{
        Popularized Spark as a tool at the company by giving
        internal talks on Spark, providing tooling for creating
        Spark clusters to run ad-hoc jobs and hosting regular
        office hours for fielding questions about Spark \&
        scalable computing
      }
      \resumeItem{
        Designed and built a system to evaluate an unsupervised
        learning algorithm for performing entity resolution,
        allowing the team to measure the impact of changes made to
        the algorithm
      }
      \resumeItem{
        Architected and implemented a fault-tolerant,
        auto-scaling system for securely running arbitrary code on
        behalf of users of the company's data science platform,
        allowing users to run batch jobs on scalable computing
        resources without concern for system load
      }
      \resumeItem{
        Trained, evaluated and deployed multi-output neural
        network models written in TensorFlow for predicting
        consumer preferences
      }
