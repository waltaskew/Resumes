          \item Architected and implemented fault-tolerant,
            auto-scaling system for securely running arbitrary code on
            behalf of users of our data science platform
          \item Built, evaluated and deployed multi-output neural
            network models trained in TensorFlow for predicting
            consumer preferences
          \item Designed and built system for performing evaluation of
            our unsupervised learning algorithm for performing entity
            resolution
          \item Researched and implemented locality-sensitive hashing
            methods for improving our entity resolution system
          \item Demonstrated advantages with a proof-of-concept
            re-implementation of our entity resolution system in
            Apache Spark capable of quickly matching input records to
            our database of 250 million entities while eliminating
            expensive database costs
          \item Performed analysis and ETL on terabytes of data using
            Apache Spark
          \item Worked primarily in Python and some Scala \& Go, deploying
