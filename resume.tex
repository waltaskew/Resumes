\section{EXPERIENCE}
        {\sl Staff Data Scientist} \hfill January 2015 - Present \\
        Civis Analytics, Chicago IL
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Lead team of four tasked with maintaining, deploying
            and improving data assets used for modeling tasks across
            the company. Provided project management, mentorship in
            engineering \& data analysis skills and helped design the
            team's quarterly road maps.
          \item Architected and implemented an entity resolution
            system in Apache Spark capable of probabilistically
            matching millions of input records to the company's
            database of 250 million entities.
            The system operated at a scale which allowed the company
            to acquire several new clients with data volumes larger
            than the company's previous entity resolution system could
            handle, while also reducing infrastructure costs by 150
            thousand dollars annually.
          \item Popularized Spark as a tool at the company by giving
            internal talks on Spark, providing tooling for creating
            Spark clusters to run ad-hoc jobs and hosting regular
            office hours for fielding questions about Spark \&
            scalable computing
          \item Designed and built a system to evaluate an unsupervised
            learning algorithm for performing entity resolution,
            allowing the team to measure the impact of changes made to
            the algorithm
          \item Architected and implemented a fault-tolerant,
            auto-scaling system for securely running arbitrary code on
            behalf of users of the company's data science platform,
            allowing users to run batch jobs on scalable computing
            resources without concern for system load
          \item Trained, evaluated and deployed multi-output neural
            network models written in TensorFlow for predicting
            consumer preferences
          \item Worked remotely in Oakland from Fall 2017 onward
        \end{itemize}

        {\sl Software Engineer} \hfill April 2012 - February 2014 \\
        Narrative Science, Chicago IL
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Planned, built and helped manage the creation of a
          free web application which allows any Google Analytics
          user to sign up for machine-generated reports on their
          websites' traffic and usage patterns
        \item Implemented an automated deployment process for the
          above web application using Amazon Web Services
        \item Designed and implemented a distributed, fault tolerant
          system for continuous ingestion and human verification of
          machine-deduced facts drawn from news headlines, allowing
          the company to build a constantly growing repository of news
          items stored as structured data
        \end{itemize}

        {\sl Software Engineer} \hfill February 2010 - April 2012 \\
        SteepRock, Inc, Remote
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Named Lead Developer for two of the company's major
          clients, tasked with ensuring the development of client
          deliverables was in line with long-term engineering goals
        \item Developed configurable solutions to meet client
          requirements and be reused as features in the company's
          growing custom web framework
        \end{itemize}

        {\sl Research Assistant} \hfill Summer 2008 \\
        Emory University, Atlanta GA
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Performed Data Mining and Natural Language Processing research
          with Professor Eugene Agichtein and his graduate students,
          eventually submitting a paper and presenting a poster at the National
          Institute of Standards and Technology
        \item Entered national academic challenges focused on data
          mining of medical corpora and recognizing textual entailment
        \end{itemize}
